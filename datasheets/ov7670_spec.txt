frame rate: 30 fps

protocol: SCCB (Serial Camera Control Bus)
protocol frequency: 97.656 KHZ ~= 100 KHZ = clock_reg(25 MHz) / 256 (clock dividing)
purpose: 
The SCCB is a proprietary protocol similar to I2C, used to communicate with the OV7670 camera module.
It is primarily used to configure the camera's internal registers. These registers control various settings like resolution, color format, frame rate, and exposure.

Clocks:

PCLK:
purpose: data collection using parallel bus - din[7:0], HREF and VSYNC synchronized with PCLK
Total Pixels Per Frame = 800 (H_TOTAL) × 525 (V_TOTAL) = 420,000
Total Pixels Per Second = 420,000 × 30 fps = 12,600,000 pixels/sec = 12.6 MHz
for the simplicity of the system and synchronization with the VGA controller, there is double sampling (60 fps):
Total Pixels Per Second = 420,000 × 60 fps = 25,200,000 pixels/sec = 25.2 MHz

XCLK:
purpose: The XCLK is the input clock to the OV7670 camera module. It serves as the master clock that drives the internal operations of the camera, including the generation of the pixel clock (PCLK) and other internal timing signals.
The OV7670 requires an external clock source (usually 24 MHz) provided by the host system (e.g., an FPGA or microcontroller).


Data Collection:

1. Camera Output:
   - The OV7670 camera generates 8-bit pixel data.
   - This data is reconstructed into a 16-bit RGB565 format, where each full image is transmitted every 2 clock cycles.
   - The camera transmits at a rate of 30 frames per second, with the capture process operating at 25 MHz. For every 2 clock cycles, 1 pixel is read.

2. Format Conversion:
   - The 16-bit RGB565 data is converted to a 12-bit RGB444 format for VGA display.

3. Data Writing:
   - The capture process writes data to BRAM (Block RAM) at 12.5 MHz, where each complete pixel is written.

4. dout Signal:
   - The `dout` signal is based on the 4 most significant bits (MSBs) of each color channel:
     dout <= latced_data(15 downto 12) & latced_data(10 downto 7) & latced_data(4 downto 1);
