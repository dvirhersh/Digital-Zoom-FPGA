Zoom Logic Explanation

1. Zoom Signal (`zoom`):
   - The `zoom` input signal determines whether the zoom functionality is enabled:
     - `zoom = '1'`: Zoom-in is enabled.
     - `zoom = '0'`: Zoom-in is disabled, and the entire frame is written to memory.

2. Row and Column Counters:
   - `counter_row`: Tracks the current row of the image being processed.
   - `counter_col`: Tracks the current column within the row.
   - These counters are incremented based on the camera's synchronization signals (`camera_h_ref` and `pclk`).

3. Selective Writing (Cropping):
   - When zoom = '1', only the pixels within a specific region of the frame are written to memory:
     - Rows: From 120 to 360 (center of the image).
     - Columns: From 160 to 480 (center of the image).
   - This effectively crops the image to the central 240x320 region (assuming the full resolution is 480x640).

4. Write Enable (`wr_en`): 
   - The `wr_en` signal ensures that only valid pixels are written to memory.
   - write_state manages timing and ensures synchronization for writing valid pixel data.
   - In zoom mode (`zoom = '1'`), `wr_en` is asserted only for pixels within the zoomed-in region.

5. Memory Addressing (`address`):
   - The `address` signal is incremented only when `wr_en = '1'`, ensuring that only valid pixel data is stored in memory.

6. pixelization
- When displaying a 240x320 image on a 640x480 VGA screen, the image is scaled up by a factor of 2x in both dimensions.
- This results in pixelization, where each original pixel becomes a block of 4 screen pixels, creating a "blocky" appearance.
- Techniques like interpolation or anti-aliasing can reduce pixelization, but they add complexity to the design.
- Without additional processing, pixelization is normal and expected due to the low resolution of the original image compared to the display resolution.

In the provided VGA module code, pixel replication (or the logic responsible for scaling) is implicit in how the **frame address** is calculated and used to read pixel data from the frame buffer. Here's how and where it happens:

- When `zoom = '0'` (No Zoom):
  - `fr_address` is incremented sequentially (`fr_address <= fr_address + 1`), meaning every VGA pixel corresponds directly to one pixel from the frame buffer. This results in a **1:1 mapping** of pixels.

- When `zoom = '1'` (Zoom Enabled):
  - The `val_zoom` and `val_tmp` signals are used to calculate the appropriate `fr_address` based on the zoomed region. However, the logic for **horizontal and vertical   	scaling** isn't explicitly shown in the code but is effectively controlled by how the pixel clock (`pix_clk`) and counters (`h_cnt` and `v_cnt`) interact with the 	`frame_address`.

In this case:
  - The frame buffer is accessed at a slower rate than the VGA display rate. For example:
  - If the input frame is 240x320 and the VGA resolution is 640x480, each pixel from the frame buffer is replicated into a 2x2 block of VGA pixels to fill the larger screen.
