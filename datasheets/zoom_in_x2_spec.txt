Zoom Logic Explanation
1. Zoom Signal (`zoom`):
   - The `zoom` input signal determines whether the zoom functionality is enabled:
     - `zoom = '1'`: Zoom-in is enabled.
     - `zoom = '0'`: Zoom-in is disabled, and the entire frame is written to memory.

2. Row and Column Counters:
   - `counter_row`: Tracks the current row of the image being processed.
   - `counter_col`: Tracks the current column within the row.
   - These counters are incremented based on the camera's synchronization signals (`camera_h_ref` and `pclk`).

3. Selective Writing (Cropping):
   - When `zoom = '1'`, only the pixels within a specific region of the frame are written to memory:
     - Rows: From 120 to 360 (center of the image).
     - Columns: From 160 to 480 (center of the image).
   - This effectively crops the image to the central 240x320 region (assuming the full resolution is 480x640).

   Example logic for zoomed-in region:
   ```VHDL:
   if (zoom = '1') then
       if (counter_row >= 120) and (counter_row < 360) and 
          (counter_col >= 160) and (counter_col < 480) then
           wr_en <= '1'; -- Enable writing to memory
           address <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(address) + 1); -- Increment memory address
       end if;

4. Full Image Writing:
   - When `zoom = '0'`, the entire frame is written to memory without any cropping:
   ```VHDL:
   else
       wr_en <= '1'; -- Enable writing for all pixels
       address <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(address) + 1); -- Increment memory address
   ```

5. Write Enable (`wr_en`):
   - The `wr_en` signal ensures that only valid pixels are written to memory.
   - In zoom mode (`zoom = '1'`), `wr_en` is asserted only for pixels within the zoomed-in region.

6. Memory Addressing (`address`):
   - The `address` signal is incremented only when `wr_en = '1'`, ensuring that only valid pixel data is stored in memory.

 How It Works in Practice
- Without Zoom (`zoom = '0'`):
  - All pixels from the camera are written to memory.
  - The full resolution image (e.g., 640x480) is stored.

- With Zoom (`zoom = '1'`):
  - Only the center portion of the image (rows 120–360, columns 160–480) is written to memory.
  - This crops the image, effectively zooming into the center region.

When a **240x320 image** is displayed on a full-screen **640x480 VGA resolution**, it undergoes a process called **scaling** or **upscaling** to fit the larger screen area. This scaling process determines how the image is presented and whether pixelization occurs.

---

 4. pixelization
- When displaying a 240x320 image on a 640x480 VGA screen, the image is scaled up by a factor of 2x in both dimensions.
- This results in pixelization, where each original pixel becomes a block of 4 screen pixels, creating a "blocky" appearance.
- Techniques like interpolation or anti-aliasing can reduce pixelization, but they add complexity to the design.
- Without additional processing, pixelization is normal and expected due to the low resolution of the original image compared to the display resolution.

In the provided VGA module code, **pixel replication** (or the logic responsible for scaling) is implicit in how the **frame address** is calculated and used to read pixel data from the frame buffer. Here's how and where it happens:

---

1. Pixel Address Scaling
The replication behavior is managed by the following part of the code, which calculates the `frame_address` for fetching pixels:

```vhdl
if (zoom = '0') then
    fr_address <= fr_address + 1;
else
    fr_address <= val_zoom - val_tmp;
end if;
```

 Explanation of Scaling Logic:
- When `zoom = '0'` (No Zoom):
  - `fr_address` is incremented sequentially (`fr_address <= fr_address + 1`), meaning every VGA pixel corresponds directly to one pixel from the frame buffer. This results in a **1:1 mapping** of pixels.

- When `zoom = '1'` (Zoom Enabled):
  - The `val_zoom` and `val_tmp` signals are used to calculate the appropriate `fr_address` based on the zoomed region. However, the logic for **horizontal and vertical scaling** isn't explicitly shown in the code but is effectively controlled by how the pixel clock (`pix_clk`) and counters (`h_cnt` and `v_cnt`) interact with the `frame_address`.

  In this case:
  - The frame buffer is accessed at a slower rate than the VGA display rate. For example:
    - If the input frame is 240x320 and the VGA resolution is 640x480, each pixel from the frame buffer is replicated into a 2x2 block of VGA pixels to fill the larger screen.

---

2. Horizontal and Vertical Counters
The horizontal (`h_cnt`) and vertical (`v_cnt`) counters determine **when and how pixel data is fetched** from the frame buffer. These counters run at the VGA pixel clock frequency (`pix_clk`), and their values dictate the scaling behavior.

Key Code Snippet:
```vhdl
if (h_cnt < CAMERA_WIDTH) then
    if (zoom = '0') then
        fr_address <= fr_address + 1;
    else
        fr_address <= val_zoom - val_tmp;
    end if;
end if;
```

 How Replication Happens:
- For every VGA pixel (h_cnt, v_cnt), the `fr_address` is calculated.
- In zoom mode (`zoom = '1'), the `fr_address` does not increment for every pixel, resulting in multiple VGA pixels being mapped to the same frame buffer pixel. This effectively replicates the pixel to fill the larger display area.

---

 3. Implicit Replication in VGA Timing
The VGA timing and synchronization logic determine how many pixels to display for each line and frame:

 Horizontal Counter (`h_cnt`):
```vhdl
if (h_cnt = (H_MAX - 1)) then
    h_cnt <= (others => '0');
else
    h_cnt <= h_cnt + 1;
end if;
```

 Vertical Counter (`v_cnt`):
```vhdl
if (h_cnt = (H_MAX - 1) and v_cnt = (V_MAX - 1)) then
    v_cnt <= (others => '0');
elsif (h_cnt = (H_MAX - 1)) then
    v_cnt <= v_cnt + 1;
end if;
```

- These counters run at the VGA pixel clock frequency.
- When `zoom = '1'`, the `fr_address` calculation ensures that the same frame buffer pixel is used for multiple VGA pixels, effectively replicating the pixel.

In the VGA controller code:
- The replication happens **implicitly** in the way the `fr_address` is calculated and how the horizontal (`h_cnt`) and vertical (`v_cnt`) counters interact with the VGA timing signals.
- Specifically:
  - In **zoom mode**, the same pixel address (`fr_address`) is used for multiple VGA pixels, effectively replicating the pixel to fill the larger screen.
- The logic is subtle and relies on the **difference in resolution** between the input frame buffer (e.g., 240x320) and the VGA output (e.g., 640x480).
