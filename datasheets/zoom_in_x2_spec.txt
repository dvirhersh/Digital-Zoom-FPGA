Zoom Logic Explanation
1. Zoom Signal (`zoom`):
   - The `zoom` input signal determines whether the zoom functionality is enabled:
     - `zoom = '1'`: Zoom-in is enabled.
     - `zoom = '0'`: Zoom-in is disabled, and the entire frame is written to memory.

2. Row and Column Counters:
   - `counter_row`: Tracks the current row of the image being processed.
   - `counter_col`: Tracks the current column within the row.
   - These counters are incremented based on the camera's synchronization signals (`camera_h_ref` and `pclk`).

3. Selective Writing (Cropping):
   - When `zoom = '1'`, only the pixels within a specific region of the frame are written to memory:
     - Rows: From **120 to 360** (center of the image).
     - Columns: From **160 to 480** (center of the image).
   - This effectively crops the image to the central 240x320 region (assuming the full resolution is 480x640).

   Example logic for zoomed-in region:
   ```VHDL:
   if (zoom = '1') then
       if (counter_row >= 120) and (counter_row < 360) and 
          (counter_col >= 160) and (counter_col < 480) then
           wr_en <= '1'; -- Enable writing to memory
           address <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(address) + 1); -- Increment memory address
       end if;

4. Full Image Writing:
   - When `zoom = '0'`, the entire frame is written to memory without any cropping:
   ```VHDL:
   else
       wr_en <= '1'; -- Enable writing for all pixels
       address <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(address) + 1); -- Increment memory address
   ```

5. Write Enable (`wr_en`):
   - The `wr_en` signal ensures that only valid pixels are written to memory.
   - In zoom mode (`zoom = '1'`), `wr_en` is asserted only for pixels within the zoomed-in region.

6. Memory Addressing (`address`):
   - The `address` signal is incremented only when `wr_en = '1'`, ensuring that only valid pixel data is stored in memory.

 How It Works in Practice
- Without Zoom (`zoom = '0'`):
  - All pixels from the camera are written to memory.
  - The full resolution image (e.g., 640x480) is stored.

- With Zoom (`zoom = '1'`):
  - Only the center portion of the image (rows 120â€“360, columns 160â€“480) is written to memory.
  - This crops the image, effectively zooming into the center region.

When a **240x320 image** is displayed on a full-screen **640x480 VGA resolution**, it undergoes a process called **scaling** or **upscaling** to fit the larger screen area. This scaling process determines how the image is presented and whether pixelization occurs.

 4. pixelization
- When displaying a 240x320 image on a 640x480 VGA screen, the image is scaled up by a factor of 2x in both dimensions.
- This results in pixelization, where each original pixel becomes a block of 4 screen pixels, creating a "blocky" appearance.
- Techniques like interpolation or anti-aliasing can reduce pixelization, but they add complexity to the design.
- Without additional processing, pixelization is normal and expected due to the low resolution of the original image compared to the display resolution.
