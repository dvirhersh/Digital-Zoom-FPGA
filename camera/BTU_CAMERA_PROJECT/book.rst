Conclusion
----------

If you've followed the guide you should know by now more or less 
how the video streams are handled on Zynq-7000 based boards.
If that's not the case then I have failed.
The code snippets can be found at GitHub repository
[#github-v6sa-zynq]_.
Most up to date VHDL and Zynq-7000
materials can be found on Lauri's blog [#lauris-blog]_.
